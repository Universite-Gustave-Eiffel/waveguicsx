## 0. Introduction

Waveguicsx is a python library for solving complex waveguide problems based on SLEPc eigensolver.

Waveguicsx is freely available under the GNU GPL, version 3, thus providing an accessible solution to the scientific community. Waveguicsx stems from expertise gained over the past 15 years through the guided wave research activity of the GeoEND team at Universit√© Gustave Eiffel in the fields of non-destructive evaluation and geophysics.

The full documentation is entirely defined in the `waveguide.py' module. See also https://universite-gustave-eiffel.github.io/waveguicsx.

Waveguicsx can deal with complex elastic waveguides, two-dimensional (e.g. plates) or three-dimensional (arbitrarily shaped cross-section), inhomogeneous in the transverse directions, anisotropic. Complex-valued problems can be handled including the effects of non-propagating modes (evanescent, inhomogeneous), viscoelastic loss (complex material properties) or perfectly matched layers (PML) to simulate buried waveguides.

More precisely, waveguicsx solves the following matrix problem: $(\textbf{K}_0-\omega^2\textbf{M}+\text{i}k(\textbf{K}_1+\textbf{K}_1^\text{T})+k^2\textbf{K}_2)\textbf{U}=\textbf{F}$. This kind of problem typically stems from the so-called semi-analytical finite element (FE) method. See references below for theoretical details.

The inputs of waveguicsx are: the matrices $\textbf{K}_0$, $\textbf{K}_1$, $\textbf{K}_2$, $\textbf{M}$ (PETSc matrix format) to compute the free response of waveguide (dispersion curves), as well as the excitation vector $\textbf{F}$ if computing forced response is required. These matrices can be built from your own favorite code. In this case, you just need to import these matrices to Python and converted them to PETSc format (see basic examples below). In case you do not have any code to generate these matrices, you can use the open finite element software FEniCSX (installation required) as shown in the tutorials.

The free response ($\textbf{F}=\textbf{0}$) corresponds an eigenvalue problem, solved iteratively by varying the angular frequency $\omega$, or alternatively, the wavenumber $k$, leading to dispersion curve results. In the former case, the eigenvalue is $k$, while in the latter case, the eigenvalue is $\omega^2$. The loops over the parameter (angular frequency or wavenumber) can be parallelized, as shown in some tutorials (using mpi4py). Various modal properties (energy velocity, group velocity, excitability...) can be post-processed as a function of the frequency and plotted as dispersion curves.

The forced reponse ($\textbf{F}\neq\textbf{0}$) is solved in the frequency domain by expanding the solution as a sum of eigenmodes using biorthogonality relationship, leading to very fast computations of the excited wavefields. The transient response can finally be processed in the time domain by inverse FFT.

The library contains two classes. The main class, the class Waveguide, enables to solve the waveguide problem defined by the following inputs: $\textbf{K}_0$, $\textbf{K}_1$, $\textbf{K}_2$, $\textbf{M}$ and $\textbf{F}$. The other class, the class Signal, is provided to easily handle the transforms of signals from frequency to time and inversely, as well as the generation of excitation pulses.

Waveguicsx can also solve scattering problems by local inhomogeneities based on transparent boundary conditions (so-called hybrid FE-SAFE method), please see the dedicated section below.

## 2. Prerequisites

Waveguicsx requires the complex version of SLEPc and PETSc (slepc4py, petsc4py).

The necessary inputs to waveguicsx are the matrices $\textbf{K}_0$, $\textbf{K}_1$, $\textbf{K}_2$, $\textbf{M}$ (PETSc matrix format) to compute the free response of waveguide (dispersion curves), as well as the vector $\textbf{F}$ to compute the forced response. These matrices can be built from any code, then imported to Python and converted to PETSc format.

**Tutorials:**

In the tutorials (see subfolder 'examples'), these matrices are built from the open finite element (FE) platform FEniCSX. To run these tutorials, you will therefore need to install FEniCSX first. Note that tutorials are py files formatted such that they can be conveniently opened in a text editor or in a jupyter notebook.

*Tutorial files are currently written for FEniCSX v0.6.0, minor modifications may be required for use with latest versions (work under progress).*


## 3. Installation

### 3.1 Clone the Waveguicsx public repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Universite-Gustave-Eiffel/waveguicsx.git
cd ./waveguicsx
```

### 3.2 Generate the docker image and run the container

FEniCSX is not a dependency of waveguicsx. Nevertheless, it is required to run the tutorials.
We recommend using the docker image of DOLFINX/v0.6.0 sourced in complex mode before running the tutorials :

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and authorize [non-root users](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

Then run the following shell script file of waveguicsx repository (launch docker container):
```bash
./launch_fenicsx.sh
```
The first run will install FEniCSX inside the container, which may take time.

*Only the first time* : once the container is launched, install the waveguicsx package using: 
```bash
[complex]waveguicsxuser@hostname:~$ python3 -m pip install -e .
```
*Warning* : the waveguicsx folder (i.e. `.`) is mounted inside the container in `/home/waveguicsxuser` :
so that all changes are persistent and modify the repository of the host system as well.  
The python package files will be installed in the `.local` folder (ignored by `git`), 
so that it is not necessary to reinstall the package with pip each time the container is launched.

Once the container is launched, here are examples of usage inside the container :
```bash
[complex]waveguicsxuser@hostname:~$ python3 ./examples/BasicExample1.py  # run a basic example (check that everything works)
```
```bash
[complex]waveguicsxuser@hostname:~$ python3 ./examples/Elastic_Waveguide_SquareBar3D.py  # run a tutorial in cli
```
```bash
[complex]waveguicsxuser@hostname:~$ jupyter notebook  # launch the jupyter notebook from inside the container
```
```bash
[complex]waveguicsxuser@hostname:~$ exit  # leave the container
```


## 4. Documentation

The documentation is entirely defined in the `waveguide.py' module.

You can also see the full documentation at: https://universite-gustave-eiffel.github.io/waveguicsx.

You can also build the documentation, using `python setup.py doc` and opening the front page in `./doc/Waveguicsx_documentation.html`.


## 5. Tutorials

Various tutorials are provided in the subfolder 'examples'. These tutorials fully depict simple as well as more complex problems, two-dimensional (plates) or three-dimensional (bars, rail...), including viscoelastic loss or perfectly matched layers (used for buried waveguides). In particular, these tutorials show how to build the finite element matrices $\textbf{K}_0$, $\textbf{K}_1$, $\textbf{K}_2$, $\textbf{M}$ with FEniCSX. Installing FEniCSX is therefore required to run the tutorials.

In case you have your own code to generate these matrices, you can readily forget FEniCSX parts in each tutorial, and only consider the part dedicated to waveguicsx.


## 6. Scattering by local inhomogeneities

Waveguicsx can also solve scattering problems by local inhomogeneities based on transparent boundary conditions.

This has been implemented in the scattering.py module, defining a third class named Scattering. The full documentation is entirely defined in the scattering.py module.

The following matrix problem is considered: $(\textbf{K}-\omega^2\textbf{M}-\text{i}\omega\textbf{C})\textbf{U}=\textbf{F}$. This kind of problem typically typically stems from a finite element (FE) model of a small portion of waveguide including a local inhomogeneity (e.g. defects). The cross-section extremities of the truncated FE model are then handled by transparent boundary conditions (BCs) to reproduce semi-infinite waveguides. Such an approach is sometimes called as hybrid FE-SAFE method (see references below for theoretical details). The so-obtained scattering problem is solved repeatedly for each frequency (using PETSc). The loops over the angular frequency can be parallelized, as shown in some tutorials (using mpi4py).

The user must supply the following inputs: the global FE matrices $\textbf{K}$, $\textbf{M}$, $\textbf{C}$ (stiffness, mass and viscous damping), the global FE vector $\textbf{F}$ (excitation inside the FE model) and the transparent BCs (localized by their degrees of freedom in the global vector U). Transparent BCs are Waveguide objects, which must have been solved prior to the scattering problem solution (see waveguide.py module).

For each angular frequency $\omega$, the solution to the scattering problem yields the displacement $\textbf{U}$ of the FE model, as well as the outgoing modal coefficients of every transparent BC.

Note that the FE matrices can be built from any code (then imported to Python and converted to PETSc format). In the tutorials, these matrices are built from the open finite element (FE) platform FEniCSX (see subfolder 'examples').
